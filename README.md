# THIS PROJECT NO LONGER WORKS
> You can blame the greedy developers of TruckersMP <br>
> Fix anti cheat? :x: <br>
> Perm ban actual cheaters? :x: <br>
> Make anti cheat for local sided things and never for actual cheats? ✔️ <br>
> Perm ban people only using local sided things? ✔️ <br>
> Ban ACTUAL hackers who troll and greif for only 6 months just so they can do it again? ✔️ <br>
> **Patch a local sided dlc bypass within 2 days, but still not stop cheaters or fix known bugs? ✔️** <br><br>

TruckersMP are a joke. If you wish to fix this yourself go ahead <br>
Is it possible? Yes.<br>
Will i do it? No.
